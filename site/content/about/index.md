## About Me

Australian (Victoria) based Network Engineer with over 15 years of experience, mainly in the Service Provider industry. My main passion is in end-to-end troubleshooting of complex networks which has contributed greatly to my Networking, Automation, Linux and Programming knowledge.

## Motivation

I created this blog and the [NPA Showcases](/npa-showcases) repository mainly for my own personal learning and mentoring of others. A lot of information I have found online as well is either very out of date, or no longer works. A lot of them also use older personal lab software which requires a beefy Home Lab. 

I am by no means an expert in a lot of these areas or have worked at a Hyperscaler or FAANG company, but my aim is to eventually have a one stop area for people to learn a lot of general Network and Infrastructure Engineering concepts. I also wanted it to be portable using GitHub codespaces so all you need is a browser to quickly fire up a lab if you want to learn or mentor someone yourself.

## Limitations

- Content in these blog posts and GitHub repositories is not designed to be used in a production environment.
- I am working on this in my free time, so updates/fixes may be slow
- As I continue learning and tinkering, some updates may completely change how things work
