## Summary

Australian (Victoria) based Network Engineer with over 15 years of experience, mainly in the Service Provider industry. My main passion is in end-to-end troubleshooting of complex networks which has contributed greatly to my Networking, Automation, Linux and Programming knowledge. During my professional career, I have also managed multiple small teams in the Network Operations and Network Architecture fields. Finally, I have served as a lead engineering resource in the Customer Engineering space for several large ($10M+) projects.

## Experience

### Network Engineer - Viasat, Inc.

`Jul 2018 -> Present`

Part of the Global Connectivity team at Viasat, who deals with the design, deployment, and support of the Viasat global network across the US, EMEA and APAC. Most of my time spent at Viasat has been spent being the lead Customer Engineer of the NBNCo Long Term Satellite System (LTSS) in Australia (Also known as SkyMuster), which is a 130,000+ user network across 10 gateway sites and 2 Data Processing Sites. This network also includes the Qantas mobility service (In Flight Connectivity) for domestic flights across Australia.

Duties and Achievements include: 
- Tier 3 support for any network issues, but my extensive knowledge of the end-to-end solution also resulted in troubleshooting Servers and Applications with other engineering teams
- The successful design & execution of 3 major network lifecycle projects
- Leading a small team of network engineers, including mentoring new graduates 
- On-call support for the Australia and Global Networks

### Integration & Configuration Engineer - NBNCo

`Oct 2015 -> Jun 2018`

Worked in the National Test Facility (NTF), where I was responsible for the maintenance of the network and server equipment that made up the HFC, Satellite, Nokia MPLS Core and Cisco VRF Management Networks.

Day to day duties included: 
- Implementation and testing of new designs and systems from the architecture teams and performing end to end regression testing (STC and IXIA) 
- BAU Operations of Network and Server equipment in the facility 
- Automation of test cases and configuration discrepancies

I took a particular interest in the Satellite network where I became a SME, and eventually moved to Viasat, who are the supplier of the NBN satellite solution.  

### Other - Various

`May 2006 -> Oct 2015`

Specifics available on LinkedIn, but in summary I started my career as a Network Administrator in the Network Operations Center at iiNet (Australian ISP), where I built up my knowledge of IP Networks, Voice networks and Linux Server Administration for several years and became a team leader at the NOC.

A couple of years later I was promoted to the Network Design and deployment team performing more advanced Network designs 
and deployments. (PCI-DSS, Peering Relationships & Large scale MPLS) 

My experience then moved to the enterprise segment where I worked at Salmat for 4 years as a Senior Network engineer dealing with the deployment, maintenance, and operations of a large business network spanning 40+ office spaces across APAC. I then worked at a couple of MSPs and worked briefly as a contractor for Juniper Networks before moving to NBNCo, which is detailed above.
